If you’ve ever thought “I should start a blog,” this is your moment. With ChatGPT and GitHub Pages (or Netlify), you can launch in under 24 hours.

### 🚀 What You’ll Need:
- ChatGPT (free or Plus) to write posts
- GitHub or Netlify for hosting
- Free HTML/CSS templates (or just ask me)
- A niche: personal finance, budgeting, side hustles

Focus on building helpful content and SEO will follow. I recommend starting with 5 evergreen posts like “Best Budgeting Apps for 2025” or “How to Save $200/Month.”
